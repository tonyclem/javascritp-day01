// A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.

//  ==================     Lexical Scope ======================== //

//Whenever you see a function within another function, the inner function has access to the scope in the outer function, this is called Lexical Scope or Closure - also referred to as Static Scope. The easiest way to demonstrate that again:

// Scope A
let myFunction = function () {
  // Scope B
  let name = "Todd"; // defined in Scope B
  let myOtherFunction = function () {
    // Scope C: `name` is accessible here!
  };
};

let myFunction = function () {
  let name = "Todd";
  let myOtherFunction = function () {
    console.log("My name is " + name);
  };
  console.log(name);
  myOtherFunction(); // call function
};
myFunction();

//Lexical scope is easy to work with, any variables/objects/functions defined in its parent scope, are available in the scope chain. For example:

let name = "Todd";
let scope1 = function () {
  // name is available here
  let scope2 = function () {
    // name is available here too
    let scope3 = function () {
      // name is also available here!
    };
  };
};

//The only important thing to remember is that Lexical scope does not work backwards. Here we can see how Lexical scope doesnâ€™t work:
// name = undefined
var scope1 = function () {
  // name = undefined
  var scope2 = function () {
    // name = undefined
    var scope3 = function () {
      var name = "Todd"; // locally scoped
    };
  };
};

//=================           Function scope ========================== //
//All scopes in JavaScript are created with Function Scope
// Scope A
let myFunction = function () {
  // Scope B
  let myOtherFunction = function () {
    // Scope C
  };
};
