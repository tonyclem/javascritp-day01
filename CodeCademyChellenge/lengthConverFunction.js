// . Create a length converter function
// Creating a function is a skill that'll be useful in many settings, and as you progress, you'll be working on much more complicated functions than this one. But a function that converts units of measure can be pretty handy in multiple professions and industries.

// Let's start with a conversion from kilometers to miles. The function should include the input in kilometers and return the answer in miles.

function convertKilometersToMiles(kilometers) {
  return kilometers * 0.621371;
}
console.log(convertKilometersToMiles(3));
