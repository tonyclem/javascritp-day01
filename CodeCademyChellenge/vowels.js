// 10. Return the number of vowels in a string
// Create a function that'll return an integer of the number of vowels found in a string. This is a great way to practice determining the features of a dataset. If you use JavaScript later in your career, you'll be well-prepared to determine what datasets (or just strings) consist of. If you feel like an extra challenge, consider returning the number of characters.

let vowels = "Hello World";

const countVowels = (str) => {
  let vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (vowels.includes(str[i])) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
};
console.log(countVowels(vowels));
