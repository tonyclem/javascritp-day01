// Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.

// Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10

for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
